    <id>http:///blog/2015/01/07/solving-tic-tac-toe</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You may recall that just a couple of days ago <a href="/blog/2015/01/04/solving-tic-tac-toe/">I posted a solution</a> on how to solve Tic-Tac-Toe. As it turns out, I greatly overcomplicated the problem. Or, well, kind of. I actually just solved Tic-Tac-Toe for humans. I wrote an algorithm on how humans might go about solving the problem. However, the great thing about computers is that they are not humans. They can do a lot of computations and remember a lot of stuff. There&rsquo;s an algorithm to solve this problem, and it&rsquo;s called Minimax.</p>

<h2>Minimax</h2>

<p>As my Google searches evolved from &ldquo;tic tac toe strategy&rdquo; (which had lead me to solving the problem for humans) to &ldquo;tic tac toe algorithm&rdquo;, I noticed people talking about this thing called &ldquo;minimax&rdquo; on programming forums. I think it&rsquo;s actually the de facto way to solve Tic-Tac-Toe, as there are hundreds resources which detail how to apply Minimax to Tic-Tac-Toe. Well, oops. I like solving things and I don&rsquo;t like doing something just because the Internet tells me it&rsquo;s the right thing to do. In order for me to use it, I had to understand how it works.</p>

<p>Minimax is a decision rule which minimizes the maximum possible loss. It involves one maximizing player (in this case, the AI), and one minimizing player (the human opponent). It was developed for zero-sum game theory, which is the mathematical representation of a situation in which a player&rsquo;s gain or loss is exactly balanced by the loss or gain of the opponent player. If the total gains of all players are added and total losses of all players are subtracted, the result will be zero, thus zero-sum. There&rsquo;s also a Minimax theorem, first published by John von Neumann (of von Neumann architecture, which almost all modern computers use) in 1928:</p>

<blockquote><p>The minimax theorem states: <br>
For every two-person, zero-sum game with finitely many strategies, there exists a value V and a mixed strategy for each player, such that <br>
(a) Given player 2&rsquo;s strategy, the best payoff possible for player 1 is V, and <br>
(b) Given player 1&rsquo;s strategy, the best payoff possible for player 2 is âˆ’V. <br></p></blockquote>

<p>Therefore, the AI needs to pick the move with the best possible payoff. What do all of the moves look like? How do we calculate the payoff?</p>

<h2>The Set of Moves Forms a Tree</h2>

<p>In Minimax, each possible move is evaluated, given a score, and then compared to the other possible moves. The one with the best payoff is chosen. We have a set of possible moves, which is like a set of paths, and ends up looking something like this:</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/christ/crs/kr-ist/copied-pics/minimax-illustration-6.jpg">http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/christ/crs/kr-ist/copied-pics/minimax-illustration-6.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>Minimax looks ahead at all possible paths, by scoring the state of the board at its maximum depth, recursively scoring the board in the parent node by choosing the best child, until the score and position reaches the root.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def minimax(depth, player)
  if gameover || depth == 0
    return calculated_score
  end
  children = all legal moves for player
  if player is AI (maximizing player)
    best_score = -infinity
    for each child
      score = minimax(depth - 1, opponent)
      if (score &gt; best_score) 
        best_score = score
      end
      return best_score
    end
  else #player is minimizing player
    best_score = +infinity
    for each child
      score = minimax(depth - 1, player)
      if (score &lt; best_score) 
        best_score = score
      end
      return best_score 
    end
  end
end

#then you would call it like
minimax(2, computer)
</code></pre>

<p>One important thing to note is the depth. You don&rsquo;t necessarily need to look ahead at all possible paths, just a few moves ahead. Also notice that this algorithm is recursive and depth-first.</p>

<h2>Calculating A Score</h2>

<p>How do we actually give a score to the state of of the board? This is the only part of the algorithm that ends up being heuristic. You have to choose a heuristic board evaluation function to calculate this value. I chose to calculate a score for each line (the three rows, the three columns, and two diagonals) on the board, and then sum these values. I scored each line as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>+100 for each three-in-a-row for the AI</li>
<li>+10 for each two-in-a-row (and empty cell) for the AI</li>
<li>+1 for each one-in-a-row (and two empty cells) for the AI</li>
<li>-1 for each one-in-a-row (and two empty cells) for the other player</li>
<li>-10 for each two-in-a-row (and empty cell) for the other player</li>
<li>-100 for each three-in-a-row for the other player</li>
<li>0 for all other states</li>
</ul>


<p>It&rsquo;s nice how simple it ends up being to score a board state.</p>

<h2>Minimax, But Better</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a different algorithm that makes Minimax better, called Alpha-beta pruning. This eliminates paths that are worse than paths that have already been evaluated. Therefore, you have to store a few more values: alpha, which holds the maxmimum score for the maximum path, and beta, which holds the minimum score for the minimum path. You throw away a path when its alpha value is >= the beta value. The algorithm is extremely similar, and the pseudo code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def minimax(depth, player, alpha, beta)
  if gameover || depth == 0
    return calculated_score
  end
  children = all legal moves for player
  if player is AI (maximizing player)
    for each child
      score = minimax(depth - 1, opponent, alpha, beta)
      if (score &gt; alpha) 
        alpha = score
      end
      if alpha &gt;= beta
        break
      end
      return alpha
    end
  else #player is minimizing player
    best_score = +infinity
    for each child
      score = minimax(depth - 1, player, alpha, beta)
      if (score &lt; beta) 
        beta = score
      end
      if alpha &gt;= beta
        break
      end
      return beta 
    end
  end
end

#then you would call it like
minimax(2, computer, -inf, +inf)
</code></pre>

<p>In alpha-beta pruning, the alpha and beta values are passed along with each recursive call of minimax. The path is discarded (by calling break within the loop) if at any moment in the path, alpha is greater than or equal to beta.</p>

<p>The score depends on which player <code>minimax</code> is currently being called on: if it&rsquo;s the maximizing player (the AI), alpha is returned as the score, and beta if it is the minimizing player.</p>

<h2>Check Out My Code</h2>

<p>If you would like to see how I implemented alpha-beta pruning for a Tic-Tac-Toe AI, <a href="https://github.com/catarak/tic-tac-toe">check out my Github repository</a>. The other solution is now on a branch called <code>heuristic-solution</code>.</p>

<p>Also, it&rsquo;s remarkable how much simpler this solution is versus the heuristic solution. Game theory and decision theory are really cool, and are definitely something I should read about more.</p>

    <updated>2015-01-04T15:09:10-05:00</updated>
    <id>http:///blog/2015/01/04/solving-tic-tac-toe</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago, when I had decided that I wanted to quit my job as a C++ developer and become a web developer, I applied to the <a href="http://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a> to immerse myself in web technologies. During the application process, I was assigned a code challenge, to create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, played either by two humans or a human against an AI player, in the language of my choosing. To challenge myself, I chose Ruby, a language I had never used before but figured that there was never a better moment to start. I applied all of the object-oriented programming fundamentals I knew from my time coding in C++ and Java, and ended up with somethiing I was pretty proud of.</p>

<h2>Refactoring</h2>

<p>After the class was over, only four months after I wrote my first Ruby code, I went back to build upon what I had previously done. It&rsquo;s fun to see how much better you&rsquo;ve gotten at something, in my opinion. It was funny to see all of the non-Rubylike things I had done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accessing data elements outside of a class&rsquo;s initialize method. For example, inside of my <code>Board</code> class:
<code>ruby
def set(index, mark)
@board[index] = mark
end
</code>
This I changed to
<code>ruby
def set(index, mark)
self.board[index] = mark
end
</code></li>
<li>Using explicit return statements at the end of methods. I was used to the world of C++ in which best practice is to be as explicit as possible, otherwise your code is really difficult to read. Again, from the <code>Board</code> class:
<code>ruby
def get(index)
return @board[index]
end
</code>
I changed this method to
<code>ruby
def get(index)
self.board[index]
end
</code></li>
<li>Unconventional method naming. What was with the question marks and exclamation points? I had written stuff like this (from <code>Board</code> class again):
<code>ruby
def is_valid(index)
if @board[index] == 'X' || @board[index] == 'O'
  return false
else
 return true
end   
end
</code>
Also, what&rsquo;s with those if and else statements? I was used to the C++ world in which that kind of logic ends up so verbose. I fixed it to look like this:
<code>ruby
def valid?(index)
return false if index &lt; 0
!self.board[index].nil? &amp;&amp; self.board[index] != 'X' &amp;&amp; self.board[index] != 'O'   
end
</code>
Much more compact and readable, and better error checking!</li>
</ul>


<h2>Designing an AI</h2>

<p>Once I had fixed my code to fit with Ruby conventions, I had a larger task to accomplish: make the AI unbeatable. I felt confident, as I had <a href="https://github.com/catarak/battleship">written an AI before for Battleship</a>. However, it turns out that designing a Battleship strategy is different from Tic-Tac-Toe. A lot different, in fact, and it tripped me up.</p>

<p>When I designed the AI for Battleship, I created a board of probabilites, based on the likelihood of a ship being in a certain position on the board. I tried to do the same for Tic-Tac-Toe, even creating a <code>ProbabilitiesBoard</code> class that was initialized to look like this
<code>
          |     |     
   3  |  2  |  3  
 _ _ _|_ _ _|_ _ _
          |     |     
   3  |  4  |  2  
 _ _ _|_ _ _|_ _ _
          |     |     
   3  |  2  |  3  
          |     |     
</code>
in which each number represents the number of different ways a player can win, based on the number of rows that interesect a position. Unfortunately, as I played out a few games and tried to recalculate my probabilities, I realised my calculation wasn&rsquo;t robust enough. It didn&rsquo;t take into account enough different possibilites of gameplay. Because, in Tic-Tac-Toe, unlike Battleship, you also have to block another player.</p>

<h2>Tic-Tac-Toe is not like Battleship</h2>

<p>So I was back to square one. I started to think about the game in certain types of moves. Certain moves won the game by making three in a row, certain moves blocked another player, certain moves created a dual threat, and so on. I had distilled the types of moves into a hierarchy as well, which looked something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you have two in a row, add a third to the row to win the game.</li>
<li>If your opponent has two in a row, add a third to the row to block him or her from winning.</li>
<li>Place your mark on the board strategically, bringing you closer to winning.</li>
</ol>


<p>This was something. I quickly implemented two methods in the <code>ComputerPlayer</code> class, <code>find_winning_move</code> and <code>find_blocking_move</code>. Because I found that I need to iterate over all of the different rows in the board, I decided to store them in my <code>Board</code> class:
&#8220;`
class Board
  attr_accessor :board
  attr_reader :rows</p>

<p>  def initialize
    @board = position_numbers
    @rows = [[0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8], [0,3,6],
             [1,4,7], [2,5,8], [0,4,8], [2,4,6]]
  end</p>

<p>  def position_numbers
    return *(1..9).collect { |x| x.to_s }
  end
  &hellip;
<code>
Now, I could iterate though all of the rows and see if any of them had two 'X's or 'O's in a row:
</code>
def find_two_in_a_row(board, mark)
  board.rows.each do |row|
    if board.only_two_in_a_row?(row, mark)
      return board.get_open_position(row)
    end
  end
  nil
end
<code>
As you see, I created a separate method in the</code>ComputerPlayer<code>class called</code>find_two_in_a_row&#8220;`, which iterates though all of the rows and tries to find two in a row of a mark passed in as a parameter. As soon as it finds a row, it returns with the empty position in the row.</p>

<h2>A Hierarchical Strategy</h2>

<p>I had created two crucial methods whith made the AI a lot smarter, but I was lost on the rest of the strategy. I decided to ask the Internet for some inspiration, and I found some help on <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Win-at-Tic-Tac-Toe">Wikihow</a> and <a href="http://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-way-to-never-lose-at-Tic-Tac-Toe">Quora</a>. However, I found it difficult to find patterns. I didn&rsquo;t want to add a lot of <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> statements which check for things like &ldquo;if the AI player went first and then the opponent moved in a corner&rdquo; then &ldquo;the AI player should put a mark in the opposite corner&rdquo;. It didn&rsquo;t feel right, and I felt like I could do better.</p>

<p>I had an aha moment when I came across <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/213570">this answer to a StackExchange question</a>. It states that a Tic-Tac-Toe strategy is based on a hierarchy of types of moves. Of course! I had gotten halfway there when I realized that winning was more important than blocking which was more important that other types of moves, but I hadn&rsquo;t been able to pin down the other types of moves. The hierarchy of moves is</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>The following algorithm will allow you (or the AI) to always deny your opponent victory:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Win:</strong>
If you have two in a row, you can place a third to get three in a row.</p>

<p><strong>Block:</strong>
If the opponent has two in a row, you must play the third to block the opponent.</p>

<p><strong>Fork:</strong>
Create an opportunity where you have two threats to win (two non-blocked lines of 2).</p>

<p><strong>Blocking an opponent&rsquo;s fork:</strong>
If there is a configuration where the opponent can fork, you must block that fork.</p>

<p><strong>Center:</strong>
You play the center if open.</p>

<p><strong>Opposite corner:</strong>
If the opponent is in the corner, you play the opposite corner.</p>

<p><strong>Empty corner:</strong>
You play in a corner square.</p>

<p><strong>Empty side:</strong>
You play in a middle square on any of the 4 sides.</p>

<p><em>Pick the highest possible on the list</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I was able to knock out most of these methods pretty quickly, except for finding forks and blocking an opponent&rsquo;s forks. These turned out to be trickier than I expected.</p>

<h2>Finding Forks</h2>

<p>In the case of finding a fork, I realized that a player only needed to find one in order to create a dual threat (and therefore win the game). I managed to map out an algorithm:</p>

<p>Iterate through all rows on the board
  if a row contained only one of the player&rsquo;s mark, and nothing else,
  then iterate thorough all overlapping rows
    if an overlapping row contained only one of the player&rsquo;s mark, and nothing else
      if it&rsquo;s not the position in which the two rows overlap,
      then you&rsquo;ve found a fork
        return the position in which the two rows overlap</p>

<p>I already knew how to iterate though all of the rows, but how do you find all of the overlapping rows? It turns out this is easier than I expected. I wrote a method for the <code>Board</code> class called <code>overlapping_rows</code> which takes a row as a parameter.
<code>
def overlapping_rows(row)
  self.rows.select{ |overlap| (overlap &amp; row).length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; overlap != row }
end
</code>
All this method does is select the rows that contain a position that is also in the row passed in, just as long as it is not the same row. The actual code in the <code>ComputerPlayer</code> class ended up looking like this:
<code>
def find_winning_fork_move(board)
  board.rows.each do |row|
    if board.only_one_in_a_row?(row, self.mark)
      overlaps = board.overlapping_rows(row)
      overlaps.each do |overlap|
        if board.only_one_in_a_row?(overlap, self.mark)
          overlapping_move = (overlap &amp; row).first
          return overlapping_move if board.valid?(overlapping_move)
        end
      end
    end
  end
  nil
end
</code>
The method returns the position to create a fork as soon as it finds the first fork.</p>

<h2>Blocking All Forks, Not Just One</h2>

<p>At first, I thought that after I had implemented a method that created forks, I could use the same code to block forks. I figured out there was a problem when I was testing with the following game:</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/images/tic_tac_toe/tricky_fork_caption.001.jpg" width="250" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;"/>
<img src="/images/tic_tac_toe/tricky_fork_caption.002.jpg" width="250" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;"/>
<img src="/images/tic_tac_toe/tricky_fork_caption.003.jpg" width="250" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;"/>
</div>


<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/images/tic_tac_toe/tricky_fork_caption.004.jpg" width="250" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;"/>
<img src="/images/tic_tac_toe/tricky_fork_caption.005.jpg" width="250" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto;"/>
</div>


<p>In the process of blocking one fork, the AI had left another one open. Therefore, it wasn&rsquo;t just as simple as finding the first fork. The AI had to find them all, and then choose the optimal place to block. First, finding all forks:
<code>
def find_possible_forks(board, mark)
  possible_forks = []
  board.rows.each do |row|
    if board.only_one_in_a_row?(row, self.opponent_mark)
      overlaps = board.overlapping_rows(row)
      overlaps.each do |overlap|
        if board.only_one_in_a_row?(overlap, self.opponent_mark)
          overlapping_move = (overlap &amp; row).first
          if board.valid?(overlapping_move)
            possible_forks &lt;&lt; [row, overlap]
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
  possible_forks.each{ |fork| fork.sort! }.uniq
end
</code>
The only problem with this method is that as it iterates over all rows, it inserts duplicate forks in a different order. Thus, the last line of the method removes these duplicates.</p>

<p>Then, I had to figure out a way to pick the proper blocking spot. I tried things like finding the position that occurs the most in the rows, but it turns out there was no correlation. I finally realized that the way to find the proper blocking move is to look ahead, by checking all moves that would block a fork. I did this in a method called <code>select_blocking_fork_move</code>, which takes a list of possible forks as a parameter. The line
<code>
possible_moves = possible_forks.flatten.uniq.select{ |index| board.valid?(index) }
</code>
creates an array of possible moves by selecting all position on the board that are open and are on the forking rows.</p>

<p>Then, while iterating over all possible moves, the AI had to look ahead. The possible move is placed on a copy of the board
<code>ruby
possible_moves.each do |move|
  test_board = Marshal.load(Marshal.dump(board))
  test_board.set(move, self.mark)
  ...
end
</code>
and then, the AI checks for one of two scenarios. First, it checks that if the blocking move creates two in a row, and then the opponent moves to block, it doesn&rsquo;t create another fork for the opponent. That&rsquo;s a lot, but I think it makes more sense if you look at the code:
<code>ruby
opponent_move = find_winning_move(test_board)
if opponent_move
  test_board.set(opponent_move, self.opponent_mark)
  if !contains_fork?(test_board, self.opponent_mark)
    return move
  end
else
  ...
end
...
</code>
As you see, I wrote a method called <code>contains_fork?</code> which checks the board for forks. The else statement within the loop checks if the possible move does, in fact, block all possible forks:
<code>
opponent_move = find_winning_move(test_board)
if opponent_move
  test_board.set(opponent_move, self.opponent_mark)
  ...
else
  test_board.set(opponent_move, (opponent_move + 1).to_s)
  if find_possible_forks(test_board, self.opponent_mark).length == 0
    return move
  end
end
</code>
The body of the else statement first removes the test opponent mark that had been put on the board, and then checks if there are any possible forks. If there aren&rsquo;t, even though this move doesn&rsquo;t create two in a row, it blocks the opponent from creating a fork.</p>

<p>And then, putting it all together:
<code>ruby
def select_blocking_fork_move(board, possible_forks)
  possible_moves = possible_forks.flatten.uniq.select{ |index| board.valid?(index) }
  possible_moves.each do |move|
    test_board = Marshal.load(Marshal.dump(board))
    test_board.set(move, self.mark)
    opponent_move = find_winning_move(test_board)
    if opponent_move
      test_board.set(opponent_move, self.opponent_mark)
      if !contains_fork?(test_board, self.opponent_mark)
        return move
      end
    else
      test_board.set(opponent_move, (opponent_move + 1).to_s)
      if find_possible_forks(test_board, self.opponent_mark).length == 0
        return move
      end
    end
  end
  nil
end
</code></p>

<h2>Pitfalls</h2>

<p>Of course, there are some things that I&rsquo;m not happy about in terms of how my code turned out.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Breaking from loops using return statements
For this project, I am a big offender of breaking out of loops using a return statement. For example, from my <code>ComputerPlayer</code> class:
<code>ruby
def find_two_in_a_row(board, mark)
board.rows.each do |row|
  if board.only_two_in_a_row?(row, mark)
    return board.get_open_position(row)
  end
end
nil
end
</code>
It&rsquo;s not very Ruby-like, I know. Because of my C++ and Java background, in which it&rsquo;s totally kosher to do that, it is one of my first instincts. I did try to refactor and figure out another way, but I think the way I have it now is the most clear, at least to me.</p></li>
<li><p>Command-line interface
I find it to be a little annoying to use. I guess I could refactor it to be a web application, but that&rsquo;s a lot more work, and the point of this was to create an unbeatable AI.</p></li>
<li><p>Storing rows in <code>Board</code> class
The &ldquo;row&rdquo; is the only part of this application that&rsquo;s not object-oriented, which I&rsquo;m not happy about. In my case, a row is an array of length three that holds three positions on the board. I hardcoded these values and stored them as part of the board. I also dislike how the method <code>overlapping_rows</code> takes a row as an argument, which is just an array. It&rsquo;s just not right.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In the future, I would figure out how to make a row an object and not just data.</p>

<h2>Check Out My Code</h2>
